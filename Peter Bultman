Ahti Saarelainen
Peter Bultman

“Tell me, whither didst thou, Ahti,
go to after the great battle,
where the mighty magic Sampo
was destroyed upon the waters?”

“Long I rested, weak and weary, 
in the homesteads of Vainola, 
but I soon grew heavy hearted, 
yearned again to live in comfort 
by the salty seas of islands, 
thus to live in peace forever. 
So I hastened to my homeland, 
though my mother well chastised me 
for my warring in the northland. 
There I lived in peace and pleasure, 
fishing, hunting, and carousing.”

“I have heard you have the Sampo,
or at least the bits and pieces
that were floating on the billows,
after the machine’s destruction.
Tell, o tell us, worthy warrior,
how you came upon those fragments.”

“Truth you heard, and long that story,
but I can tell you what happened
in the northland to the fragments
of the magic lid in colors.
So, in those days there were raiders
coming from the western waters
from the lands of Thor and Odin.
Some such riders came upon me
in the nighttime on the shoreline 
while I was without defenses.
Recklessly they set upon me,
but I then revealed my nature.
Not a fisher, not a peasant,
but instead they found a fighter.
So instead of wanton warfare,
they invited me to join them,
offered me a chance to join them 
in their raids upon the northland. 
So I went with them to Pohja, 
there to seek revenge on Louhi 
for her breaking of the Sampo. 
Long I thought, and well considered 
how to bring the hag to justice, 
how to punish all of Pohja. 
So I led the foreign raiders 
to her homestead in the northland; 
searched and searched, 
but could not find her- 
could not find the witch of Pohja. 
But her homestead had not vanished; 
it was still in dreary Lapland. 
So we took the homestead from her, 
stayed at first for but an evening. 
But upon the daylight’s dawning, 
all the raiders saw the richness
 brought to Louhi by the Sampo. 
So we thought, and well considered, 
what to do with all her riches; 
took a day to rest and ponder. 
Then, instead of next day’s dawning, 
woke to find the sun had vanished! 
So we armed ourselves with crossbows, 
looted all the witch’s weapons, 
and begat a mighty bonfire 
to bring light where should be sunlight. 
Saw then by the light of fire, 
saw approaching in the distance 
evil Louhi, with a satchel 
hanging from her beak of evil. 
All the raiders fled the homestead; 
nervous Norsemen soon surrendered
 to the hag of Sariola. 
I too fled, but not a coward; 
fled I but a little distance. 
Scarcely had I gone a distance 
when the witch of dismal Pohja 
flew again towards the mountain 
where before she stowed the Sampo. 
From the mountain shone the sunbeams; 
from the caverns beamed the moonlight. 
Scarcely had a month passed over,
as I watched and waited, patient, 
when I saw the mighty Louhi, 
bowed and bent, and nearly broken, 
go again into the caverns,
give the moon and sun their freedom. 
That I saw, and grew courageous, 
so I went then to the homestead, 
hailed the wicked witch of northland, 
spoke these words in wrath to Louhi: 
‘Frail you are, and weak, and wicked. 
You have lost your precious Sampo, 
failed to take the sun from Northland. 
Give to me your unearned treasures; 
give to me the parts of Sampo 
that you snatched during the battle.
Give to me my rightful treasure,
give to me the things of beauty,
that you carried on your finger,
from the sinking of the Sampo.’
Cowed was she, the creeping coward,
begged to keep the last reminder 
of her wealth and of her daughter.
So I left her with some remnants,
as befits my noble nature,
took the best of all the fragments
also took the lid in colors 
snatched by Louhi from the Sampo”
“Whither bound were you then, Ahti?
Wither didst thou take the fragments?”
“I returned then to the islands,
took the magic parts of Sampo
to my homestead, to my mother.
Gave to her the beauteous pieces,
gave some also to my sister.
Kept for me the lid in colors,
sought to recreate the Sampo.
But I was not very skillful,
could not forge like Ilmarinen,
could not craft like Väinämöinen.
So I hid the lid in secret, 
and continued with my raiding
on the shores of distant Pohja,
also on the homes of Norsemen
who abandoned me in Pohja,
just revenge for their betrayal.”
“Tell me, Ahti Saarelainen,
how you settled in Wainola,
how you left your island homestead”
“Though my raiding brought me riches,
brought me wealth, and fame, and fortune
I could not do it forever,
far too soon grew old and tired.
Could not fight the nasty Norsemen,
could not best the Pohjalanders.
So I lingered in my homestead,
comforted my dying mother.
After she had left the islands,
left her home for high Jumala,
passed into the arms of Ukko,
I then talked to Ilmarinen,
talked of all our past adventures.
He convinced me to rejoin him
in the land of Kalevala,
there to spend our days in leisure
in the kingdom of Karelia.
There I was not Lemminkäinen,
called instead now by my birthplace,
called now Ahti Saarelainen.
So I spend my days with Seppo,
waiting for the day we’re needed,
waiting for old Väinämöinen
to return to Kalevala,
be the guiding light of Suomi.
When he comes we will be with him,
at his side, with sword and hammer,
ready to assist the minstrel
in whatever way is needed.”
