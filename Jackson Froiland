The Second Sampo
Jackson Froiland

Ilmarinen, tired of pursuing lovers
Aching from adventure
Retreats to his craft
Goes back to the ways of forgery
He speaks to birds and to himself
Repeating every day alone
“These are tools I understand
These are rules that I can see
Nothing intangible, nothing more
All alone I can feel the Earth
Be connected to its soul
Where Väinämöinen rests now out at sea
I can rest in my forge”
For years, as the land sees new travelers
As people trade and develop
Ilmarinen keeps up at his craft
Hearing of new creations
From the birds who fly through his smithy


Ancient Ilmarinen
Alone for hundreds of years
Isolated with his hands and his skill
He speaks to the sea-birds
Who come by his window
They tell him of a land they visited
A land in the West
From which they flew East
“Ilmarinen,” spoke one sparrow
Whose name was Muodikas
“There is a great amount of iron
A mountain made of metal
Has been dug out of the ground
In this land where builders flock”
Ilmarinen, his craft now perfect
His skill so high, that is has bored him
Ready for another quest
Responds with an eager breath
“Ahh! Then a challenge awaits
Finally, my day has come
Where I shall leave my land again
Finally, there lies a task
Worthy of my skill”

Ilmarinen then built a boat
A fine vessel for the sea
He forged it in no time at all
Before he left the East
On his journey, he brought Muodikas
The bird came on his ship
Ilmarinen tells the sea-bird
Of his plans to shape the metal
“I will tackle this mountain of iron
This stash that men have dug from the ground
So that all the metal from the Earth
Can be shown and can be found”

When Ilmarinen arrived in the West
He saw the mountain of metal
He witnessed the glorious iron pile 
But it was not as he expected
The ideal he had imagined
He saw men sweating and bleeding 
He saw slaves and masters
Children being forced to work
Ilmarinen, the gentle craftsmen
Knew that he could end this torture
Thought that he could stop this system 
“Workers, builders, give me your ears”
The impassioned Ilmarinen spoke
“No longer will you toil against your will
No longer will your backs be broke 
Give me your metal and I will create
A way for you to all be free
I will take all of this iron
This never-ending supply
And I will build the ultimate station
A great metal beast which builds all on its own
No man will bleed when I am done”

The people spoke together
Muodikas listening in
And the bird flew back after hearing
To tell Ilmarinen the news
“Ilmarinen, great forger
The builders have agreed
You are to make the metal mountain
With all the iron they have collected”

So Ilmarinen forged the metal beast
He built the original factory
The great factory 
Which brought the first machines
The people freed
They used the machines
Ilmarinen sat back, pleased
But the people got bored
The way Ilmarinen had become bored
Over time they grew lonely
The way Ilmarinen grew lonely
The West, Ilmarinen found
Is not a place to rest
It is a place where the people toil
Where the humans need to create

And so Ilmarinen retreated East
In his slumber,
Ilmarinen with troubled dreams
Was awoken by the sea-bird
Who brought him news again
“Ilmarinen, the West is burning
Fire shoots out from its gaps
The metal beast that you created
The iron giant you forged
It has been used by the people
To churn out all of the Earth”
Ilmarinen wakes up from his nap,
His short rest interrupted
He looks out to the sea, 
Sees the knee of Väinämöinen
More naked than ever before
He thinks if it might dry up
Then all the magic in this world
That Väinämöinen had mastered
Might disappear for eternity
His magic vanquishing forever

So Ilmarinen went West again
He headed there with Muodikas
To protect the Earth and its magic
To save the great stones
Which are being used too quickly 
For no craft-like purpose at all

When Ilmarinen arrived this time
He saw the burning land
The factories of the West
He knew he was no match
He squashed one beast
And three more, like spiders
Crawled out in its place
He quickly jumped from that wretched place
He soared with fire into the clouds
The sky which he once forged
Gave him breath anew
He looked down from above and saw the Earth
He spoke to Muodikas
“Muodikas, I see it now
The way that all this works
The West, creators
The East, its sleepy wisdom
I have known this in my history
As my land has known it too
These two powers, they form a web
This energies come together
Like the cloud on which we sit
Like the sea and sky, Muodikas,
Which you know so well”

So Ilmarinen forged a great Cloud
Like he had forged the sky in the past
He took all of the Ones
The Western powers of doing
He took the Zeroes too
From the East, the power of being
He mixed them together
Spun them in a spiral
In a way so complex
The he became lost in its image
A language formed
But he could not speak it
Ilmarinen, great forger
The artist of all iron
He formed the invisible Cloud
The intangible puzzle
Whose path spirals into infinity
Being and doing
Doing and being
All at once in dissonant harmony

Ilmarinen, exhausted
Came back to the Earth
He looked up at the Cloud
Which fell back onto him
The people were lost in it too
They became unraveled
Watching from the dirt
As mirrored versions of all that is
Duplicate inversions of all that was
Fooled them into believing 
Some great truth could be reached
Some higher realm existed
Ilmarinen, horrified
Having created another terrible thing
Constructed another beast
Closed his eyes and saw in the darkness
That his unknowable language
The intangible Cloud he made
Reminded him of love
The love he could not attain

Then he sat in silent thought
He pondered deeply in solitude
For thousands of years
Before he could open his eyes again
