Väinämöinen is known and loved by many for his infinite wisdom, astonishing magic, musical talent, and, most importantly, his heroic display in Elias Lönnrot’s Kalevala. However, with his departure in Canto 50 of the epic, fans are wondering what Väinämöinen has been up to since his appearance in the Kalevala. Why did Väinämöinen leave? What does his current life look like? What are his thoughts on Finland and its people today? Does he still play the kantele? All of these burning questions and more will be answered in this month’s edition of Epic Interview with Epic Magazine.

_____________________________________________________________________________

I would like to thank you on behalf of myself, fans, and Epic Magazine for allowing me to interview you today, Väinämöinen. I know it’s been quite a journey for you since leaving mortal territory. So, let’s start with the basics. How have you been? 
Thank you for having me. I’m happy to answer your questions. To say that I’ve been on a journey since my departure from Karelia is an understatement. I feel that at the present moment, I am the best version of myself. 
Why do you say that? 
Since my presence in Kalevala, I’ve had time to myself for once in my life. Well, besides the nine years that I spent floating in the sea after my birth. But during those nine years, though I spent much time in my mother’s womb before I was born, I was still lacking a certain wisdom and happiness. The wisdom that I initially began with was spent toward things in life that were never going to work out for me, such as finding a wife. 
Have you not found a wife yet? Are you still searching for one since Aino’s death? 
Aino’s death deeply affected me. It’s truly a shame that she rejected a life full of love, adventure, and emotional fulfillment. She could have had it all with me. Consequently, I’m no longer searching for a wife. Companionship is a beautiful concept, but I find more fulfillment in playing music, sailing the glassy seas, and exploring the bountiful lands of Finland. 
Where do you currently reside? 
It’s comical how life pans out. I began in the sea, and I will end in the sea. Since sailing away from Karelia, I remained on my copper boat that I cultivated with my magic. The sea is full of endless possibilities, and it’s where I can experience freedom in its purest form. The Baltic Sea and the North Sea are my favorite bodies of water. 
Speaking of sailing away from Karelia, why’d you do it?
You mean besides the Newborn King of Karelia telling me like it is? Well, the truth of the matter is that I wasn’t needed anymore. At first, I was ashamed of this. I am the great Väinämöinen, after all. Who wouldn’t need me? Then I had an epiphany. With a new moon, a new sun, and a new king, the people of Karelia needed to build a history. They needed to build a culture. They were, and still are, more than capable to do this without me. But, if a time comes when they need me to fix a new Sampo, to make a new music, to convey a new moon, or to set free a new sun, I’ll be there. In the meantime, they have my kantele, which I hope has brought the Finnish peoples earthly joy.
Since you left your kantele behind, what do you play in your free time?
Oh, I still play the kantele. With all of my traveling, I’ve found plenty of organic materials to construct a new one. Music and art help us to connect with the nonmaterialistic aspects of life and to genuinely connect with the earth. 
Are you updated on current events in Finland?
Since leading a life of sublimity and maritime adventure, I’ve been quite detached from the mortal realm. But, being a god and an epic hero, I can at least manage to read a copy of the Helsinki Times once in a blue moon. 
What specific events have caught your eye recently? 
I tend to stay away from negative news on business, commerce, or anything that undermines Finland as a unified nation. Materialistic news is not my thing. Maybe it’s something that Joukahainen would be interested in. For me, news on art, music, and culture—all things that I hoped my kantele would help the nation appreciate—interests me the most. Recently, an art festival in Helsinki entitled artArctica Festival has taken place to display and honor the many beautiful sides of the Arctic. This festival included photography, movies, music, poetry, dance, and other art forms to unify those who appreciate the nature of the Arctic. This news brought me great joy, as it exemplifies what I wanted to bring to Finland all along. To see the people of Finland unite through art and culture and bond with other countries is what a truly peaceful and happy nation should do. Stories like this make me proud. 
It looks like our time together is up. Thank you for your time and wisdom, Väinämöinen.
It was my pleasure.
